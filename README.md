# AIDevX

Welcome to AIDevX, a platform for software development agents powered by AI.

AIDevX agents can do anything a human developer can: modify code, run commands, browse the web,
call APIs, and yes‚Äîeven copy code snippets from StackOverflow.

## üíª Running AIDevX Locally

AIDevX can also run on your local system using Docker.
See the Running AIDevX guide for system requirements and more information.

> [!WARNING]
> On a public network? See our Hardened Docker Installation Guide
> to secure your deployment by restricting network binding and implementing additional security measures.

```bash
docker pull aidevx/runtime:latest

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=aidevx/runtime:latest \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.aidevx-state:/.aidevx-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name aidevx-app \
    aidevx/aidevx:latest
```

You'll find AIDevX running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

When you open the application, you'll be asked to choose an LLM provider and add an API key.
[Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)
works best, but you have many options.

## üí° Other ways to run AIDevX

> [!CAUTION]
> AIDevX is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation.
> It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in authentication, isolation, or scalability.
>
> If you're interested in running AIDevX in a multi-tenant environment, please
> [get in touch with us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)
> for advanced deployment options.

You can also connect AIDevX to your local filesystem,
run AIDevX in a scriptable headless mode,
interact with it via a friendly CLI,
or run it on tagged issues with a github action.

Visit the AIDevX documentation for more information and setup instructions.

If you want to modify the AIDevX source code, check out the Development guide.

### Custom Scripts

AIDevX supports custom scripts that run at different points in the runtime lifecycle:

- **setup.sh**: Place this script in the `.aidevx` directory of your repository to run custom setup commands when the runtime initializes.
- **pre-commit.sh**: Place this script in the `.aidevx` directory to add a custom git pre-commit hook that runs before each commit. This can be used to enforce code quality standards, run tests, or perform other checks before allowing commits.
